# Operating Systems, Networks and Distributed Systems - CO2017 - University of Leicester 2016-17

This is a set of projects in java for the "Operating Systems, Networks and Distributed Systems" course.

It includes the following programs:
1. A server socket that handles client data streams and prints their information
2. A data reader that allocates memory blocks using multithreading. The system allocates memory according to the different policies: First fit, Best fit and Worst fit. And then shows how the different fits behave and the time they require to run.
3. A server/client application that works like and old-fashioned chat/message board.
